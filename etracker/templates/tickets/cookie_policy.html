    <h1>The use of the Cookies and Local Storage</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Type of Cookies We Use</h2>
    <p>Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when You go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as You close your web browser.</p>
    <p>We only use session Cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Necessary / Essential Cookies</strong>
        <p>Type: Session Cookies</p>
        <p>Administered by: Us</p>
        <p>Purpose: These Cookies are essential to provide You with services available through the Website and to enable You to use some of its features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services that You have asked for cannot be provided, and We only use these Cookies to provide You with those services.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Type of Local Storage We Use</h2>
    <p>We use sessionStorage or localStorage to save your light or dark colour theme preference as well as your approval or disapproval of persistent Cookies and Local Storage for the Website.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Browser local storage</strong>
        <p>Administered by: Us</p>
        <p>Purpose: Some websites use local storage called "sessionStorage" and "localStorage" to store information; "sessionStorage" is automatically deleted when the browser program is closed; instead to delete the "localStorage" the user must delete the browsing history.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>By declining the use of Local Storage, your settings will be moved and stored only temporarily in the browser's sessionStorage and automatically deleted once the browser tab is closed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By accepting the use of Local Storage, your settings will be stored in the browser's localStorage and be available for the next time You use the Website.</p>
    <p>Our purpose of storing your preferences in localStorage is to provide You with a more personal experience and to avoid You having to re-enter your preferences every time You use the Website.</p>
    <br>
